title: "A multi-asset, single-page crypto wallet"
---

To help myself learn about crypto, I developed a simple multi-asset wallet. You can find it [here](https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet).

Here are some reasons it might appeal to other users:

1. It is a single-page app. This means there is no reload between actions, like viewing transactions, making payments, etc. This allows for a faster, seamless user experience, and is particularly apt for a crypto wallet due to the the prevalence of copy-paste address transfers performed by the client.

2. The interface is integrated with a database of display names, which can help reduce user error when transacting to and from otherwise opaque cryptographic addresses. All users are free to add display names to their addresses, which subsequently display alongside their address for all other users.

3. It is a browser wallet, which means it is immediately accessible on essentially any modern device.

4. It also has Progressive Web App (PWA) support, which means you can install it for a native app experience.

5. It incorporates a _security quote protocol_, which as far as I'm aware is a novel feature among browser wallets. The upshot is that the security quote makes the wallet as secure as a native app or browser extension, but with no need for manual installation. I will write a separate post about this soon.

6. The interface is minimal and accessible. No Courier New, "I'm-a-hacker" nonsense.

7. The currency portfolio is inherently curated. The wallet currently supports Nano, Banano, Solana, and Stellar. I included these mainly because they were reasonably developer-friendly. This is an important quality that can help determine whether a crypto project might succeed.
