title: "Cryptocurrencies are poor stores of value"
---

Cryptocurrencies should not be used as stores of value. This is a strong claim to make for a crypto-beginner like me, so if you disagree, please think of this as the Q to your A.

### Societies grow; cryptocurrencies do not

The common refrain from crypto advocates is that fiat is inflationary, while most cryptocurrencies are not. Thus, cryptocurrencies should be used as a store of value.

However, no one ever claimed that currencies are a good store of value. No one ever became wealthy by investing in currencies, or even gold. (_Trading_ of course is a different story, but that is very hard.)

What people have claimed is that you should invest in stocks (essentially companies) or bonds (essentially governments). The rationale for this is assertion that dividends returned to you will exceed initial capital investment. In turn, the case for this corresponds roughly with the assertion that companies and governments, in aggregate, produce more than they consume. 

I think this is a reasonable assertion. Even if not, it presents you with a Pascal's wager: If you truly believe that companies and governments - essentially, people - are consuming more than they produce, than civilization and humanity are unsustainable and you may as well jump ship.




### Centralization insures against theft and errors

For the typical individual not involved in criminal activity, the main threats toward their personal value are user error, criminal theft, and poor investment decisions.

A well-regulated financial system offers protection and insurance against falling to the former two. As for investment advice - that's an intractable problem, but reputable institutions generally help stave off disaster.

Cryptocurrencies offer no protection against user error and criminal theft. Further, at the present moment, it's hard for me to believe that most crypto advocates have your best interests in mind when recommending investments.

### Transactions and exchanges

My take is that the value of cryptocurrencies lies entirely in their utility in facilitating transactions.

There is a case that cryptocurrencies also offer value in facilitating exchanges (namely, through smart contracts). I am still skeptical of this due to the [oracle problem]({% post_url 2022-02-01-crypto-space %}).
