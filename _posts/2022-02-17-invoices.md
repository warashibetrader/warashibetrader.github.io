title: "Accepting payments using Transact"
---

I added a few new features to the wallet: support for URL-based invoices and receipts, as well as a little invoice tool, directly in the app. It seems the app is no longer just a wallet though, so I've decided to refer to it as [Transact](https://transactcc.github.io). Here are four levels of payment automation, in order of sophistication.

### Invoice a static product or service (URL)

The in-wallet tool should suffice to produce the URL you need. For instance, I used the tool to make this [donation link](https://transactcc.github.io/?preferred=XNO&addresses=%257B%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7%2522%257D&items=%255B%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Donation%2520to%2520Transact%2520developer%2520%28in%2520general%252C%2520the%2520description%2520of%2520a%2520good%252Fservice%29%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%25221.00%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Supplemental%2520tip%2520%28optional%29%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%255D&iSig=C815911C9A5B9F6A5BA080DC48BD2D7D854FBCA6B170E7312443A8744A94B465E2DAC14970E35C4539D9B5337885746D88601D5EF969B8A349430262FE14470F&ship=false&email=false).




### Create a button opening a new tab (HTML)

It's not very professional to ask for payment from an in-line link, and possibly disruptive for the link to leave the current website. A little HTML creates a button which opens the invoice in a new tab:

<button style="display:block; margin:auto;"><a style="color:#333" target="_blank" href="https://transactcc.github.io/?preferred=XNO&addresses=%257B%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7%2522%257D&items=%255B%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Donation%2520to%2520Transact%2520developer%2520%28in%2520general%252C%2520the%2520description%2520of%2520a%2520good%252Fservice%29%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%25221.00%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Supplemental%2520tip%2520%28optional%29%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%255D&iSig=C815911C9A5B9F6A5BA080DC48BD2D7D854FBCA6B170E7312443A8744A94B465E2DAC14970E35C4539D9B5337885746D88601D5EF969B8A349430262FE14470F&ship=false&email=false">Donate!</a></button>

Here is the HTML code in plaintext:

	<button style="display:block; margin:auto;">
		<a id="myInvoiceButton" style="color:#333" target="_blank" href="[insert your paymentURL]">Donate!</a>
	</button>


### Invoice a dynamically populated shopping cart (Javascript)

If you want to construct an invoice based on say, a customer's shopping cart, then you will need to generate a payment URL on the fly. This will need a tiny bit of javascript. Include the following function in the global scope of the javascript on your webpage:

	function makePaymentURL(preferred, addresses, items, iSig, ship, email) {
		const url = new URL('https://transactcc.github.io');
		url.search = new URLSearchParams({preferred:preferred, 
					      addresses:encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(addresses)), 
					      items:encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(items)), 
					      iSig:iSig, ship:ship, email:email});
		return url;
	}

The makePaymentURL function generates and returns the URL for an invoice filled using the six input parameters (the last three are optional). Use this URL for your payment link/button. For instance, using the same HTML for the button above,

	let preferred = "XNO";
	let addresses = {XNO: "nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7"};
	let items = [{item:"Donation to Transact developer (in general, the description of a good/service)", XNO:"1"}, 
		     {item:"Supplemental tip (optional)"}]; 
	let iSig = "C815911C9A5B9F6A5BA080DC48BD2D7D854FBCA6B170E7312443A8744A94B465E2DAC14970E35C4539D9B5337885746D88601D5EF969B8A349430262FE14470F";
	let ship = false;
	let email = false;
	
	document.getElementById("myInvoiceButton").href = makePaymentURL(preferred, addresses, items, iSig, ship, email);
    
Remarks: 1) Notice that the _addresses_ parameter implies that you can choose to accept multiple currencies. This is actually not supported at the time of writing. It wouldn't hurt to include extra currencies in your _addresses_ or _items_ parameter, but currently the customer will only be able to pay using the _preferred_ currency.
 
2) The invoice signature (iSig) is not so easy to fill and probably should be left blank (the signature is one advantage of using the in-app tool). Attempting to programmatically fill it probably requires someone technically aware enough to audit the rest of Transact's client code. The rough idea would be to do call something like _sign(JSON.stringify(items))_. The difficulty is including the _sign_ function in your code, which first of all would vary based on currency, but seecond of all would require you to derive and store your signing key correctly.
    
### Listen for and respond to payment confirmation (more Javascript)

You may want to programmatically respond to a customer's payment. One solution is to set up a crypto network websocket to listen directly for payments to your store's wallet address. However, this will not deterministically correlate with invoices recorded to this crypto wallet, especially if for instance, the customer leaves a tip.

Fortunately, I have implemented direct support for confirmation signaling from the wallet's window. This step requires slightly more sophisticated javascript. While we're at it, we may as well start from scratch to marginally improve the cosmetics of the transaction (like shortening the URL). Include the following function in the global scope of the javascript on your webpage:
	
	function startPayment(preferred, addresses, items, iSig, ship, email, processTransaction) {
		let popup = window.open('https://transactcc.github.io');
		window.addEventListener("message", function(event) { 
			if (event.source == popup && event.data) {
				if (event.data.cue == "readyCue") 
					popup.postMessage({cue:"replyCue", 
						     	   preferred, addresses, items, 
						     	   iSig, ship, email}, "*"); 
				if (event.data.cue == "paidCue" && processTransaction) 
					processTransaction(event.data.id);
				if (event.data.cue == "closeCue") 
					popup.close();
			}
		});
	}

The startPayment function initiates a payment based on the first six input parameters. The last parameter should be a function, which will be called when the payment is confirmed. This function has access to a single parameter, which is the transaction ID. For instance, you can use this to confirm the payment on the crypto network directly. (Of course, you want to let your server do this. The client cannot be trusted to run your site's code.)

The following example creates a thank-you alert when the client completes a payment. First, the button,

	<button id="jsInvoice" style="display:block; margin:auto;">Donate!</button>

and then the javascript:

	let preferred = "XNO";
	let addresses = {XNO: "nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7"};
	let items = [{item:"Donation to Transact developer (in general, the description of a good/service)", XNO:"1"}, 
		     {item:"Supplemental tip (optional)"}];		     
	let iSig = "C815911C9A5B9F6A5BA080DC48BD2D7D854FBCA6B170E7312443A8744A94B465E2DAC14970E35C4539D9B5337885746D88601D5EF969B8A349430262FE14470F";
	let ship = false;
	let email = false;
	function myPaymentResponse(transactionID) {
		alert("Thank you!");
		// Then send transactionID to your server. 
		// Have your server verify the transaction on the crypto network directly.
		// Possibly do more after verification.
	}
	
	document.getElementById("jsInvoice").onclick = function() {
		startPayment(preferred, addresses, items, null, false, false, myPaymentResponse);
	};

Demo, using exactly the above three blocks of code:

<button id="jsInvoice" style="display:block; margin:auto;">Donate!</button>

<script>	
function startPayment(preferred, addresses, items, iSig, ship, email, processTransaction) {
	let popup = window.open('https://transactcc.github.io');
	window.addEventListener("message", function(event) { 
		if (event.source == popup && event.data) {
			if (event.data.cue == "readyCue") 
				popup.postMessage({cue:"replyCue", 
						   preferred, addresses, items, 
						   iSig, ship, email}, "*"); 
			if (event.data.cue == "paidCue" && processTransaction) 
				processTransaction(event.data.id);
			if (event.data.cue == "closeCue") 
				popup.close();
		}
	});
}

let preferred = "XNO";
let addresses = {XNO: "nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7"};
let items = [{item:"Donation to Transact developer (in general, the description of a good/service)", XNO:"1"}, 
	     {item:"Supplemental tip (optional)"}];
let iSig = "C815911C9A5B9F6A5BA080DC48BD2D7D854FBCA6B170E7312443A8744A94B465E2DAC14970E35C4539D9B5337885746D88601D5EF969B8A349430262FE14470F";
let ship = false;
let email = false;
function myPaymentResponse(transactionID) {
	alert("Thank you!");
	// Then send transactionID to your server. 
	// Have your server verify the transaction on the crypto network directly.
	// Possibly do more after verification.
}

document.getElementById("jsInvoice").onclick = function() {
	startPayment(preferred, addresses, items, null, false, false, myPaymentResponse);
};
</script>
