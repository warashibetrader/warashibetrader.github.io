Title: "Accepting cryptocurrencies using Crypto Wallet"
---

I added URL support for invoice generation, as well as a little invoice generator tool directly in the [crypto wallet](https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet). Here are five degrees of usage, in order of sophistication.

### URL: Single or static product

The in-wallet tool should suffice to produce the URL. For instance, I used the wallet to make [this](https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet?preferred=XNO&addresses=%257B%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7%2522%257D&items=%255B%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Donation%2520to%2520the%2520developer%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522A%2520memo%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%255D) donation link.




### HTML: Button which opens a new tab

It's not very professional to ask for payment from an in-line link, and possibly disruptive to leave the current website. A little HTML creates a button which opens in a new tab:

<button style="display:block; margin:auto" target="_blank" href="https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet?preferred=XNO&addresses=%257B%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7%2522%257D&items=%255B%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Donation%2520to%2520the%2520developer%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522A%2520memo%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%255D">Donate!</button>

Here is the HTML code in plaintext:

    <button style="display:block; margin:auto" target="_blank" 
          href="https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet?preferred=XNO&addresses=%257B%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522nano_1gpquwssoy8491ajmxp9cxjb3o38imcxidissob7cxc38o6h6r4d8gg639b7%2522%257D&items=%255B%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522Donation%2520to%2520the%2520developer%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%25221%2522%257D%252C%257B%2522item%2522%253A%2522A%2520memo%2522%252C%2522XNO%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%255D">Donate!</button>

### Javascript: Customer-populated shopping cart

If you want to dynamically construct an invoice based on say, a customer's shopping cart, then you will need to generate a URL on the fly. You will need a little javascript support. Include the following code in the global scope of your site:

  function makePaymentURL(preferred, addresses, items) {
      const url = new URL('https://warashibetrader.github.io/crypto/wallet');
      url.search = new URLSearchParams({preferred:preferred, addresses:encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(addresses)), items:encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(items))});
      return url;
  }
