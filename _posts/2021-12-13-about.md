> Once upon a time there lived a young man named Yosaku. Not having a farm of his own, he wandered from village to village, helping other farmers and living off of the vegetables he received for his efforts. And with no home of his own, he slept in Buddhist temples, where he would pray to Kannon, the Goddess of Mercy. "Kannon, every day I work hard. I have no home of my own. Please give me a place to stay tonight. And let me find work again tomorrow."
> 
> One night, Kannon appeared at Yosaku's side, immersed in gold light, and said to him, "Wake up, Yosaku." Kannon spoke to him: "Yosaku, you are an admirable man. However poor you may be you never complain and you help people for the smallest of pay. I'm going to provide you with a happy life. Tomorrow, the first thing you touch will reap great rewards for you." With these words, Kannon disappeared.
> 
> The following day, as Yosaku headed out to work, he tripped on a stone on the roadside and fell down. "Ouch!" he exclaimed. When he stood up, he found himself holding a stalk of straw. "I wonder if this straw is what Kannon told me to hold on to. How is this going to make me happy?" Puzzled, he resumed walking.
