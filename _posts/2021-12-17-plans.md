I am making up the goals and rules for this Warashibe Trading Challenge (WTC) as I go. I have some vague ideas in mind:

1. Grow value using only an online identity, with no deliberate connection to or reliance on an IRL identity. Use only a single email address set up at the start of the challenge (warashibetrader@gmail.com). Guiding principle: Anonymity.
2. Grow value online, relying on an IRL identity if convenient, but without relying on an employee-employer relationship. Guiding principle: Independence.
3. Grow value online through whatever means available. Guiding principle: Hikikomori.
4. Grow value using crypto: Guiding principle: None.

By which am I most drawn? Probably (1). In the current era, (2-4) are hardly challenges; they're realities.
