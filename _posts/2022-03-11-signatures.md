title: "Signed invoices and receipts"

[Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/) now supports the signing of invoices and receipts.

The invoicer has the option of signing their invoice with their cryptocurrency private key. The signature is attached to the invoice URL, and Transact automatically validates the signature when a customer loads a receipt from URL. The presence of a validated signature is indicated on the pre-payment summary panel.
