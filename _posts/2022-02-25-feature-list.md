Here is an updated list of some of the more interesting features on Transact:


#### Features

1. Transact supports multiple assets curated for energy efficiency, speed, and low network fees: Nano, Banano, Solana, Stellar, and Algorand.

2. Addresses are displayed alongside human-readable aliases/usernames, which are free for the address owner to set and update.

3. Transactions are attached to invoices and receipts, automatically tracking and organizing orders for the merchant. Meanwhile, the customer has additional peace of mind, as they are able to see in-app exactly the same invoice and receipt that the merchant sees.

4. Invoicing, payments, and receipts are integrated and extremely simple. Merchants create one-click invoice links, from which customers pay using the familiar app interface. Receipts are automatically saved and displayed in-app to both parties.

Updates (3/11/2022):

5. Receipts are end-to-end encrypted and hence entirely private.

6. Invoices can be cryptographically signed to give the customer peace of mind. Receipts are always signed to give the merchant peace of mind (by fixing the terms of the transaction).


#### Distribution, security, and user interface

1. Transact is a web app. It is immediately available via its URL on any device with an up-to-date browser, facilitating frictionless adoption.

2. It supports the PWA framework. Saving to homescreen provides a native-app experience.

3. Transact uses a novel [security quote protocol]({% post_url 2022-02-02-security-quote-protocol %}), which makes the web app as secure as a native app or browser extension.

4. The app has a minimal but feature-dense single-page design, facilitating speed and efficiency, while reducing the probability of user error.

5. Transactions can be searched and filtered.
