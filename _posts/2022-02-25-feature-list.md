Here is an up-to-date list of some of the more interesting features on [Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/):

#### Objectives

1. Vertically integrate payments processing, from merchants and invoicing, all the way to customers and receipts.

2. Do so in a secure way. End-to-end encrypt everything that can be end-to-end encrypted. At the time of writing, this means that Transacts servers have access to _nothing_, other than your chosen display name - which everyone has access to.

3. Do so in a way that makes adoption seamless, usage effortless, and everything as fast as possible.

4. Everything which is free to maintain is free to use. Client code is open source and auditable.





#### Main features

1. Transact supports multiple assets curated for energy efficiency, speed, and low network fees: Nano, Banano, Solana, Stellar, and Algorand.

2. Addresses are displayed alongside human-readable aliases/usernames, free for the address owner to set and update.

3. Transactions are attached to invoices and receipts, automatically tracking and organizing orders for the merchant. Meanwhile, the customer has additional peace of mind, as they are able to see in-app exactly the same invoice and receipt that the merchant sees.

4. Invoicing, payments, and receipts are integrated and extremely simple. Merchants create one-click invoice links, from which customers pay using the familiar app interface. Receipts are automatically saved and displayed in-app to both parties.

Update (3/15/2022):

5. Invoices can require the customer to attach shipping and email addresses. These address can be saved per public key, making checkout seamless. They are encrypted: Transact servers have no access.

#### Security and privacy

1. Transact uses a novel [security quote protocol]({% post_url 2022-02-02-security-quote-protocol %}), which makes the web app as secure as a native app or browser extension.

Update (3/11/2022):

2. Invoices and receipts are end-to-end encrypted and hence entirely private.

3. Merchants have the option to cryptographically sign invoices to give the customer peace of mind. At the other end, receipts are always signed to give the merchant peace of mind (by fixing the terms of the transaction).


#### Distribution and usability

1. Transact is a web app. It is immediately available via its URL on any device with an up-to-date browser, facilitating frictionless adoption.

2. The app supports the PWA framework. Saving to homescreen provides a native-app experience.

3. The app has a minimal but feature-dense single-page design, facilitating speed and efficiency, while reducing the probability of user error.

4. Transactions can be searched and filtered.
