Here is an updated list of some of the more interesting features on Transact:


#### Features

1. Transact supports multiple assets curated for energy efficiency, speed, and low network fees: Nano, Banano, Solana, Stellar, and Algorand.

2. Addresses are displayed alongside human-readable aliases/usernames, which are free for the address owner to set and update.

3. Transactions are attached to invoices and receipts, allowing merchants to automatically organize their orders (and customers to have the peace of mind that the merchant will necessarily have a detailed record of their order).

4. Invoicing, payments, and receipts are integrated and extremely simple. Merchants create one-click invoice links, from which customers pay using the familiar wallet interface. Receipts are automatically saved and available from the app for both parties.

Updates (3/11/2022):

5. Receipts are end-to-end encrypted and hence entirely private.

6. Invoices can be cryptographically signed to give the customer peace of mind. Receipts are always signed to give the merchant peace of mind (by fixing the terms of a transaction).


#### Distribution, security, and user interface

1. Transact is a web app. It is immediately available via its URL on any device with an up-to-date browser, facilitating frictionless adoption.

2. It supports the PWA framework. Saving to homescreen provides a native-app experience.

3. It uses a [security quote protocol]({% post_url 2022-02-02-security-quote-protocol %}), which makes the wallet as secure as a native app or browser extension.

4. The app has a minimal but feature-dense single-page design, facilitating speed and efficiency, while reducing the probability of user error.

5. Transactions can be searched and filtered.
