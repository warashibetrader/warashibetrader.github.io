title: "The Warashibe Trading Challenge"

Here's the story of how I came to this point.

### The challenge

I got the idea for a "Warashibe Trading Challenge" (WTC) while playing with tiny amounts from Nano faucets. I was reminded of the [One Red Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip) project and saw on Wiki that this had historical roots in the legend of the [Warashibe Chōja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Millionaire). Having a trading background, something clicked.

I've decided that the WTC will be an attempt to stir around miniscule amounts of cryptocurrency purely obtained from faucets, and absolutely not in exchange for fiat currency. This could generalize to other forms of digital value; the two taboos will be fiat and analog value. 

I have played with some options trading in the past. It's conceivable that some intelligent trading can allow small quantities to grow rapidly. Of course, the crypto space is not the same as the options space. But I plan to play with some interesting ideas made possible by the Nano/feeless ecosystem, and hopefully we'll have some fun along the way toward likely failure.



### Finding Nano 

Why Nano, or crypto, for that matter? I recently got fed up with my equities broker for one reason or another. This possibly deserves its own future post; presently, I won't discuss this any further.

Up to and during this time, I was not particularly impressed by the cryptocurrency space. Take Bitcoin, for example: A transaction on the Bitcoin network takes (flat) fees of between $10 and $100. However much equities trading is bogged down by regulation and incompetence, it still appears absolutely frictionless in comparsion. In addition to the exorbitant fees, I was not impressed by Bitcoin's environmental footprint. My understanding was (and again, still is) that Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed, in that scarcity and security are both "generated" by tying them to the cost of energy.

I did have in the back of my mind that, being mostly mathematically literate, I could look into the Bitcoin whitepaper at some point and optimize away these issues. The space of cryptographic protocols and algorithms is relatively unexplored, and it was hard for me to believe that the original Bitcoin protocol was the best. (Of course, there have been many cryptocurrency protocols since Bitcoin. But I also suspected that their protocols were sub-optimal due to compatibility-baggage, as well as greed.)

Due to recent frustrations with my reliance on flawed financial institutions, I bit the bullet and began researching the cryptocurrency space. The very first cryptocurrency I found on Google (searching for something like "feeless crypto") turned out to look very promising. This was Nano. After a few weeks of research, I've gotten to like (the idea of) Nano more and more. 

First of all, Nano is essentially the opposite of Bitcoin, which has now entirely pivoted from trying to be a currency toward being a questionable store of value. My belief is that using cryptocurrency as a store of value is a terrible idea. The current, heavily regulated, "cold" financial system is designed precisely to reliably and safely store value, unless you are involved with underground activity. For the typical individual, user error and criminal theft are far, far, far greater threats than centralized government shenanigans, and the existing infrastructure does a reasonable job of addressing both. Cryptocurrency does not.

Nano is the opposite (or at least, it should be if it isn't already). Nano is feeless, fast, and transparent. These properties make it perfect for the enormous (and in some sense, growing) segment of the "hot" economy involving small payments, including retail-scale purchases and trading. I can envision this generating new economies that cannot even exist under the current system, involving self-publishing and royalty micropayments.
