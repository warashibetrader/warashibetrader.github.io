Let me tell the story of how I came to this point.

### Finding Nano 

I recently got fed up with my equities broker for one reason or another. This possibly deserves its own future post; presently, I won't discuss this any further.

Up to and during this time, I was not particularly impressed by the cryptocurrency space. My impression was that it was full of scams and fees. Take Bitcoin, for example: My understanding was (and still is) that a transaction on the Bitcoin network takes (flat) fees of between $10 and $100. However much equities trading is bogged down by regulation and incompetent brokers, it still appears absolutely frictionless in comparsion. In addition to the exorbitant fees, I was not impressed by Bitcoin's environmental footprint. My understanding was (and again, still is) that Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed, in that scarcity and security are both "generated" by tying them to the cost of energy.

I did have in the back of my mind that, being mostly mathematically literate, I could look into the Bitcoin whitepaper at some point and optimize away these issues. The space of cryptographic protocols and algorithms is relatively unexplored, and it was hard for me to believe that the original Bitcoin protocol was the best. (Of course, there have been many cryptocurrency protocols since Bitcoin. But I also suspected that their protocols were sub-optimal due to compatibility-baggage, as well as greed.)

Due to recent frustrations with my reliance on flawed financial institutions, I bit the bullet and began researching the cryptocurrency space. The very first cryptocurrency I found on Google (searching for something like "feeless crypto") turned out to look very promising. This was Nano. After a few weeks of research, I've gotten to like (the idea of) Nano more and more. 

First of all, Nano is essentially the opposite of Bitcoin, which has now entirely pivoted from trying to be a currency toward being a questionable store of value. My belief is that using cryptocurrency as a store of value is a terrible idea. The current, heavily regulated, "cold" financial system is designed precisely to reliably and safely store value, unless you are involved with underground activity. For the typical individual, user error and criminal theft are far, far, far greater threats than centralized or government shenanigans, and the existing infrastructre does a reasonable job of addressing both. Cryptocurrency does not.

Nano is the opposite (or at least, it should be if it isn't already). Nano is feeless, fast, and transparent. These properties make it perfect for the enormous (and in some sense, growing) segment of the "hot" economy involving small and micro payments, including retail-scale purchases and trading. I can envision this generating new economies that cannot even exist under the current economic system, involving self-publishing and royalty micropayments.

### Warashibe Trading Project

I got the idea for the Warashibe Trading Project (WTP) while playing with tiny amounts of Nano from Nano faucets. I thought of (and still think of) Nano as a sort of digital commodity, and was reminded of the [One Red Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_red_paperclip) project. I saw on Wiki that this had historical roots in the [Warashibe Ch≈çja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Millionaire) folk tale. Having a trading background, as discussed above, something clicked.

I've decided that the WTP will be an attempt to stir around miniscule amounts of cryptocurrencies purely obtained from faucets, and absolutely not in exchange for fiat currencies; and to see what happens. I have played with some options trading in the past, and have seen how some intelligent trading can cause such quantities to grow rapidly. Of course, the crypto space is not the same as the options space, and this attempt could be dead on arrival. But I plan to play with some interesting ideas made possible by the Nano ecosystem, and hopefully we'll have some fun along the way toward likely failure.
