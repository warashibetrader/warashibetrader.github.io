title: "Learning about the crypto space"

When I started this blog a few weeks ago, I basically knew nothing about cryptocurrency and defi. I now know a little. Here is what I have learned, using no jargon.

### A network of accounts

At the risk of stating the obvious, a cryptocurrency is not literally a commodity, the way the venacular ("a bitcoin" or "bitcoins") would suggest. It is more accurate to think of every cryptocurrency as a means for tracking a network of accounts, each with a purported balance.

### Trustless validation

Suppose Alice wants a bag of groceries from Bob. Alice could show Bob a bank account statement with a purported balance. She could agree to subtract away some money from this statement and never use the subtracted amount. Bob could add the same amount to his own account statement, and feel free to use his increased quantity. This interaction would constitute payment for the groceries.

Of course, this scenario in isolation is ludicrous, in the contexts of both traditional finance and the crypto/defi space. The modified account statements mean nothing without validation by others.

In traditional finance, one or a small number of individuals validate the transaction - say, Wells Fargo (in conjunction with a small number of some higher governmental powers which I don't really understand). This system works because Wells Fargo is trustworthy.

In the crypto space, the goal is to have a large number of participants in the system validate each transaction, without assuming that any one of them is trustworthy. Whatever means by which this validation is achieved is the key innovation behind each cryptocurrency.



### Smart contracts

Naively, trustless validation seems like it could be useful for more than just validating the _transfer_ of an in-house cryptocurrency from Alice to Bob. One could hope that whatever valiation mechanism is used could be upgraded to the validatation of the _exchange_ of a pair of commodities. 

Since "commodity" can be very broadly defined, people get very excited about this. You can envision using this trustless validation to confirm the sale of a house, for instance. Upgrading trustless validation from _transfers_ to _exchanges_ is the promise of smart contracts.

### The oracle problem

The problem with the previous proposal is that cryptography is not engrained inside, say, the walls of your house. Someone needs to link your house to some tokenized digital entity which can be integrated into the cryptosystem hoping to oversee its sale. 

A distributed verification of this link would necessarily be complicated and correspondingly expensive. It is not clear that such a system would make things more reliable. Instead, the effect of such a system might just be pointless obfuscation, shifting trust from one centralized party to another, or from one centralized party to a slightly distributed collection of parties.

### A comment about efficiency

The crypto space is not strictly more efficient than traditional finance. This is easy to see by thinking in terms of specialization. Centralized entities are specialized and thus very efficient at what they do. Insisting on distributing the work of verification necessarily decreases efficiency in this regard.

On the other hand, centralization harms the _economics_ of finance, by creating monopolies which hold the power to misprice their services (upward). 

The question is whether the decentralizing forces of the crypto space improve financial economics more than they decrease efficiencies from specialization.

I am not so sure that there is much of a spectrum with respect to the first of these effects: Each crypto project will either succeed in decentralizing, or it won't. Most of the color in the crypto space arises from the latter effect of efficiency loss: the more complicated, the greater the efficiency loss. The question is, how complicated can you get before the effort becomes worthless?

This is perhaps why I skew toward Nano and likeminded currencies: They aim to be as simple as possible, with very little efficiency loss.
