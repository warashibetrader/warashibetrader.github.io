title: "End-to-end encryption of receipts/invoices"
---

[Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/) now supports end-to-end encryption of receipt and invoice data.

But why would receipts sometimes still be public? 

End-to-end encryption requires both parties to first set up a "mailbox." Literally, this corresponds to generating and publishing (to Transact's servers) a public encryption key, using their private keys. 

In the context of cryptocurrency, everyone conveniently already has a private key/seed: the one that corresponds to their crypto funds. However, they still need to publish their public encryption key. On Transact, this happens automatically when you set up a public display name or send your first transaction on Transact.

If you are trying to transfer crypto to an address and Transact says that the receipt will be public, this means that the destination address has never set up a public display name with Transact.
