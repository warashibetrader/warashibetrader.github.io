title: "End-to-end encryption of invoices and"
---

[Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/) now supports end-to-end encryption of invoice and receipt data.

But if encryption is supported, why would this data ever need to be public (as sometimes indicated when trying to make a transfer)?

End-to-end encryption requires both parties to first set up a "mailbox." This involves generating and publishing (to Transact's servers) a public encryption key. This happens automatically on Transact when you set up a public display name or conduct your first transaction. An account which has not yet done one or the other on Transact will not be able to receive encrypted invoice or receipt data.

Note: Sometimes, even an account with a display name cannot receive encrypted invoice or receipt data. This is because Transact does populate display names with some public alias databases. These will display even if the account has never used Transact.
