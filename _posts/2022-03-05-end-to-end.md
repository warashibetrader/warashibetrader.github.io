title: "End-to-end encryption of invoices and"
---

[Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/) now supports end-to-end encryption of invoice and receipt data.

But if encryption is supported, why would this data ever need to be public (as sometimes indicated when trying to make a transfer)?

End-to-end encryption requires both parties to first set up a "mailbox." This involves generating and publishing (to Transact's servers) a public encryption key. This happens automatically when the user sets up a public display name or conducts their first transaction on Transact. An account which has completed neither will not be able to receive encrypted invoice or receipt data.

Note: Sometimes, even an account with a display name cannot receive encrypted invoice or receipt data. This is because Transact also populates display names with some public databases. These will display even if the account has never used Transact.
