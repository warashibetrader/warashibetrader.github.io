title: "End-to-end encryption of invoices and"
---

[Transact](https://transactcc.github.io/) now supports end-to-end encryption of invoice and receipt data.

But if encryption is supported, why would this data ever need to be public (as sometimes indicated when trying to make a transfer)?

End-to-end encryption requires both parties to first set up a "mailbox." This involves generating and publishing (to Transact's servers) a public encryption key paired with their private keys. 

In the context of cryptocurrency, everyone conveniently already has a private key: the one that corresponds to their cryptocurrency funds. However, they still need to publish their public encryption key. This happens automatically on Transact when you set up a public display name or conduct your first transaction.

If you are trying to transfer crypto to an address and Transact says that the receipt will be public, this means that the destination address needs to either set up a public display name, or make a transaction.
